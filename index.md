## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.JPG">


Welcome and Servus! I'm an economist currently working at IIASA's [Migration and Sustainable Development](https://iiasa.ac.at/programs/population-and-just-societies-popjus/migration-and-sustainable-development) research group. I recently graduated with a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics. Besides juggling with data and running regressions, I'm also a football addict and always miss my bike when I'm not on it.

## Research Interest

Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to explore various areas of economic research. I've been involved in projects related to education, labor, and development. However, my main expertise lies in political economy and spatial economics. In [my thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qqt01yuy4crucl1sf2744/Master_Thesis.pdf?rlkey=oyei7ddrr0ktun4bdnbrcnvdf&dl=0), I examined the impact of locust swarms on conflict patterns and food security in Africa. To do this, I conducted a geographically disaggregated analysis, dividing the sample into hexagonal cells of equal size and estimating the incidence of conflict for each cell as a function of swarms and a set of covariates.

## About Me

Welcome and Servus! I am an economist currently working at the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research in Vienna. I recently graduated with a master's degree in Applied Economics from the Paris School of Economics.

## Research Interest

Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to explore various areas of economic research. I've been involved in projects related to Education, Labor, and Public Economics. However, my main expertise lies in Development Economics, specifically focusing on Empirical Conflict Studies. In my thesis, I examined the impact of locust swarms on conflict patterns and food security in Africa. To do this, I conducted a geographically disaggregated analysis, dividing the sample into hexagonal cells of equal size and estimating the incidence of conflict for each cell as a function of swarms and a set of covariates.

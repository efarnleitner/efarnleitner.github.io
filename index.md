## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.JPG">


Welcome and Servus! I'm an economist currently working as pre-doctoral research assistant for Prof. Raster (LSE). I recently graduated with a master's degree in economics from the Paris School of Economics. Besides juggling with data and running regressions, I'm also a football addict and always miss my bike when I'm not on it.

## Research Interest

Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to explore various areas of economic research. I've been involved in projects related to education, labor, and public economics. However, my main expertise lies in political economy and spatial econometrics. In my thesis, I examined the impact of locust swarms on conflict patterns and food security in Africa. To do this, I conducted a geographically disaggregated analysis, dividing the sample into hexagonal cells of equal size and estimating the incidence of conflict for each cell as a function of swarms and a set of covariates.
